  Documentation & specifications for the Speckle Server & Speckle Objects.
  
  https://speckle.works

  This document is an OpenApi v.2.0 specification for Speckle. It does *not* cover the realtime communication layer (websockets).

  There are two main parts you should look at:
  ### 1. Operations
  This section describes all the available `operations` that the speckle server can perform, revolving around a simple `Accounts` system, `Clients` (keeping track of all the receivers and senders), `Streams` (main data structure) and `Objects`.

  ### 2. Schema Defintions
  This section describes the basic building blocks that Speckle works with. It also contains an extensive list of `Payloads` and `Responses` which are less interesting, but a through look at the `SpeckleObject` and its children is needed, especially if you're looking into implementing your own application specific converter. 

  *Important note*: the following speckle object types `Polyline, Curve, Mesh, Brep` are treated server side in a special manner, as they can be unbounded in size.
