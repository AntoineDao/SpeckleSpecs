    Creates and stores in the database a SpeckleObject.

    It will recursively look through the object's properties and store any "heavy" geometries (Brep, Mesh, Curve and Polyline) in the Geometries database. All other geometries are stored within the object itself.

    Response will contain the `objects` and `geometries` arrays of the saved documents.
